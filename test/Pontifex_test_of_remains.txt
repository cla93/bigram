the many kind Christmas greetings. May the Lord bless you all Dear young people Jesus wants to be your friend and wants you to spread the joy of this friendship everywhere. The Child Jesus reveals the tendernees of Gods immense love surrounding each one of us. God does not reveal himself in strength or power but in the weakness and fragility of a new babe. Let us draw from the crib the joy and deep peace that Jesus comes to bring to the world. In the face of the Child Jesus we contemplate the face of God. Come let is adore him Our Mother Mary is full of beauty because she is full of grace. May the joy of the Gospel be always in our hearts especially this Christmas. Before the Nativity scene may we pray in a particular way for those suffering persecution for the faith. Christ comes among us at Christmas it is the perfect time for a personal encounter with the Lord. The Lord is coming.
